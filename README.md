travel-tinder is a webapp for those that want to go somewhere but don't know where to go.\
Pick any place in the world and then a category and like away.\
This was built using Flask, HTML, CSS and some javascript.
## Why?

This was part of a hackathon in which we won the prize for the theme of the hackathon. We thought it would be a cool idea to make tinder but for traveling in order to have interesting experiences when going abroad.
